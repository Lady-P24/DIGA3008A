    <h3>My Web design journey</h3>
    <h2>Design goal for my Website</h2>
    <p>My goal is to produce a cohesive experience while creating intuitive pathways that guide visitors through my diverse content. 
       My target audience are creatives across all platforms. These are web designers, filmmakers, photographers ,writers etc. 
       With this in mind I intend to create a navigation system that encourages these different users to explore my web and to not feel overwhelmed or confused by my different content types.</p>
       <p>Each content will be put into its perspective category: About, Essays, Blogs, Photography, Film, and Web design. 
        These are my current categories, but they are subjected to change whether its adding or removing. 
        I will be keeping each category presentation consistent, but they will have unique attributes. 
        For example the Photography and film sections will be more visually driven, while essays and blogs will prioritize readability with complementary visuals. </p>
        <p>I aim to use colours to differentiate each page. 
            Homepage would be gradient with a mixture of dark and bright colours that accommodate each other. 
            I have an idea of which colours I would like to use however, I’m not confident on my colour theory knowledge as of yet so an intensive research on colour theory is what I plan to do before locking in the official colours. 
            My Homepage will be very minimalistic I’ll be showcasing featured work from each category. 
            Primary Navigation: A prominent, fixed navigation bar containing my main categories will be implemented and this will remain accessible regardless of where users travel within the site.
        </p>
        <p>Implementing consistent interface elements across the site will help maintain familiarity on my website for example: Global Navigation: Persistent menu accessible from all pages 
            Trails: Show users their location within the site hierarchy 
            Visual Previews: Thumbnail galleries for visual content 
            Interactive Content Sliders: For featured work showcases 
            Minimal Scroll-Triggered Animations: To enhance engagement without distraction I plan to maintain consistent layout patterns across content types ,using visual cues to indicate current section (colour coding or icons). 
            With this being said, I have the following websites that inspires my website. This is from the Colour coordination, to the images, layout and structure of certain pages. 
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://themarcus.com/"target="_blank">Marcus Erkisson</a></li>
                  <li><a href="https://www.lightfactorynow.com/"target="_blank">Light factory</a></li>
                  <li><a href="https://www.audiomilitia.com/"target="_blank">Audio Militia</a></li>
                </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Addition notes:
            URL Scheme and Semantic Markup Relationship URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) and semantic markup are both fundamental to creating an organized, accessible, and SEO-friendly website.
             When thoughtfully integrated, they work together to enhance user experience and improve how search engines interpret your content.
            </p>
            <p>When your URL scheme and semantic markup are properly aligned
                You get an improved SEO: Search engines better understand your content relationships and structure
                •	Enhanced navigation: Users can intuitively understand where they are in your site hierarchy
                •	Accessibility: Screen readers and assistive technologies can more accurately represent site structure
                •	Content maintenance: Content organization becomes more manageable with clear structural patterns
                •	Link sharing: URLs become more meaningful when shared on social media or other platforms

                    In the middle to lower part of my screen , my pages will be displayed for users to click on them which will take them to access the content on that page. They will be situated in a rectangular box with sharp harsh ends. 
                    My logo will be situated at the top left corner of the screen and will be the same colour as the , About, bar menu as well as my pages on the screen.</p>
