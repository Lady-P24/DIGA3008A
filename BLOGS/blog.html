                                  Setting up GitHub was effortless. However, navigating around the software has been a bit tricky because it is my first time stumbling across this platform. I haven't published on Github yet because i'm a bit uncertain on how to go about. I am planning on getting all the necessary help i can receive from my fellow classmates.
                                   <h3>Reflection on readings</h3>
                                   Looking at the Reading "The World-Wide Web" by Berners-Lee et al. It provides a detailed introduction to the World Wide Web (WWW) aka (W3). This platform is seen as an innovative way to share information  that could be easily used by anyone regardless of where they are in the world. Berners-Lee talks about how the "Key components of the web" such as Uniform Resource Locator (URL),Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) makes navigating the web easier. 
                                   The article presents the Web as a system designed to be open, distributed, and interconnected. Sharing and exchanging knowledge across different fields, from science to education to business. Which in my opinion the web is doing exactly that and MORE taking into consideration how vast it is in this day and age. The internet can be a great place or a terrible space depending on how YOU use it. 
                                   what i found most interesting was how the original concept of WWW was not to just browse but to allow users to be web editors so that different voices can be shared. "You could use it to edit &lt;HTML&gt; documents on your local computer" Berners-Lee clearly saw websites as "editable destinations where users interacted with one another. He wanted to build a digital space not just of consumption but of creation as well."
                                   "Unfortunately, the WorldWideWeb browser never really caught because it only worked on NeXT computer"s which were expensive and not everyone could afford it. 
                                   To be honest i'm glad that the WEB is not as open as Tim would have liked it to be imagine the different misconstrued ideologies one would have to face everyday when they open the NET. However a site that does embody the "editable characteristic" is wikipedia but even with that , its not as open as Tim would have liked it to be. 
                                   My goal for this course:
                                   Is to learn and apply the components of HTML ,CSS and Javascript. And to produce a functioning website with the knowledge obtained in this course. By the end of this course ,i  hope to surpass the current knowledge i have of the web and be able to critically elucidate the history of the web and its relationship to south Africa.

                              <p class="excerpt e-content"> <h3>Moulthrop reading review</h3>Moulthrop looks at Hypertext or the internet through McLuhan’s “laws of Media” to understand it. This law has 4 effects which are:
                                Enhancement: Allows for a More interactive experience. Hypertext enhances the readers ability to interact with text.( How a technology enhances existing capabilities.)
                                Obsolescence: Hypertext makes traditional, linear forms of writing and reading (such as books and newspapers) obsolete.( What the technology makes obsolete.)
                                Retrieval: Hypertext retrieves older forms of communication, especially oral and non-linear storytelling. This can be seen in the way hypertext resembles oral traditions, where narratives could shift and change depending on context, audience, and interaction.( What older technology or process it retrieves.)
                                Reversal: Hypertext, when pushed to extremes, may lead to fragmentation and disorientation. The complexity and infinite possibilities that hypertext presents could overwhelm readers, making it difficult to follow a coherent narrative or even understand the text as a whole.(How the technology, when pushed to extremes, may reverse its effects)
                                Moulthrop applies these laws to hypertext and argues that hypertext significantly transforms how we interact with information allowing us to create new ways of constructing or consuming digital content.
                                In the reading, the internet is seen as this disruptive technology that challenges traditional modes of storytelling, education, and communication. He doesn’t see this as something bad but rather progressive. Even though Moulthrop sees this transformation as something positive, he does however note that the complexity and interactivity of hypertext might result in readers becoming overwhelmed or disoriented. Which in my opinion, is something that happens in this day and time. When we have to much information at our disposal we tend to feel a bit overwhelmed.
                                <h3>Website Design</h3>
                                Honestly I would like to make my website simple and loud (I still don’t understand what I mean by this but I believe I will as time goes). I’ve changed my wireframe structure at least three times because I’m not really sure how I want it to look exactly “Aesthetically”.
                                I have attached links to inspirational websites that i'll be using as reference throughout the process of my web design.</p>

                            <p class="excerpt e-content"><h3>My user alignment for my creative Multi-Content Website:</h3>

                              I plan to produce a cohesive experience while creating intuitive pathways that guide visitors through my diverse content. My target audience are creatives across all platforms. These are web designers, filmmakers, photographers etc. With this in mind I intend to create a navigation system that encourages these different users to explore my web and to not feel overwhelmed or confused by my different content types.
                      
                             <h3>My Content Organization</h3> 
                              
                               Each content will be put into its perspective category: Essays, Blogs, Photography,Film, and Web design. These are my current categories, but they are subjected to change whether its adding or removing. I will be keeping each category presentation consistent, but they will have unique attributes. For example the Photography and film sections will be more visually driven, while essays and blogs will prioritize readability with complementary visuals.
                              
                              <h3>My User Experience flow</h3>
                              
                               My Homepage will be very minimalistic, there’ll be a use of large, high-quality visuals with brief descriptive text to immediately communicate my creative identity as well as showcasing featured work from each category.
                              
                               Primary Navigation: A prominent, fixed navigation bar containing my main categories will be implemented and this will remain accessible regardless of where users travel within the site.
                              
                              <h3>My Interface Elements</h3>
                              
                               Implementing consistent interface elements across the site will help maintain familiarity on my website for example:
                              <ul>
                                <li> Global Navigation: Persistent menu accessible from all pages</li>
                                <li>Trails: Show users their location within the site hierarchy</li>
                                <li>Visual Previews: Thumbnail galleries for visual content</li>
                                <li>Interactive Content Sliders: For featured work showcases</li>
                                <li>Minimal Scroll-Triggered Animations: To enhance engagement without distraction</li>
                              </ul>
                               I plan to maintain consistent layout patterns across content types ,using visual cues to indicate current section (colour coding or icons). URL Scheme and Semantic Markup Relationship
                               URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) and semantic markup are both fundamental to creating an organized, accessible, and SEO-friendly website. When thoughtfully integrated, they work together to enhance user experience and improve how search engines interpret your content.
                              <h3>When your URL scheme and semantic markup are properly aligned</h3>
                               You get an improved SEO, Search engines better understand your content relationships and structure
                              <ul> 
                                <li>Enhanced navigation: Users can intuitively understand where they are in your site hierarchy</li>
                                <li>Accessibility: Screen readers and assistive technologies can more accurately represent site structure</li>
                                <li>Content maintenance: Content organization becomes more manageable with clear structural patterns</li>
                                <li>Link sharing: URLs become more meaningful when shared on social media or other platforms</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>

                          <p class="date">Week 4</p>
                          <p class="excerpt e-content">As previously noted, I had some difficulty sticking to a single structure for my wireframe design, but over time,
                            I eventually figured it out because I had made a commitment to one.  
                            Designing the website from the viewpoint of a user that I assumed would be interested in it was another task that I found difficult. 
                            In a way, that made me question my design choices by forcing me to consider the user as well as the design.  
                            But by learning more about IxD, I gained confidence and just pictured what I would like to see on a website as a user to make my life easier on a website.
                            I am pleased to have understood the concept of IxD which is about designing intuitive navigations on a website and am aware of how it could enhance the navigation of my website.  
                            But I still have a lot to learn about it, and I just need to figure out how to apply that knowledge more effectively.  
                            There isn't much about my design that I would like to modify at this time; my colours, however, are something I'm still unsure of and need to decide on.

These colours will be put together to make a  linear gradient, which will be use as the background of the home page. Each page will have its primary colour based on the homepage gradient. 
                          <h3>visual Representation</h3>on my homepage my top right  screen will have a bar aka burger menu which will contain all my content pages. 
                          The bottom right screen will have the about text which a user can click on to get to the about page. 
                          In the middle to lower part of my screen , my pages will be displayed for users to click on them which will take them to access the content on that page. They will be situated in a rectangular box with sharp harsh ends. 
                          My logo will be situated at the top left corner of the screen and will be the same colour as the , About, bar menu as well as my pages on the screen. 
                          <h3> Fonts and Readability</h3>
                       Combination of the stegris family or livemono family for fonts - My logo text will be around “40 to 48px”. 
                       Each page heading will be around “32 to 36px”. 
                       My about text will be around “18 to 20 px”. The menu bar diemensions will be around “68x44” (subject to change).
                        Paragraph text will be around 18px. Headings on each page will be 36px to 48px. “Copyright text” will be around 14px to 16px. Situated at the bottom left corner of every page.

                    <p class="date">Week 7</p>
                    <p class="excerpt e-content"><article>I will be examining the use of UI and ux design in the website <a href="https://herri.org.za/10/"target="_blank">HERRI</a>. 
                       The primary reason this website interests me is that it is a digital repository of South African art and culture.  
                      It makes scholarly material available to the general public so that it can become public knowledge.  
                      The way they turned every website update into an "issue" and developed distinct themes for each "issue", targeting distinct content, i find that creative. 
                       <h3>Pros:</h3>
                      The website's images are fascinating and relevant to each topic, without blending together.
                      Educates the public about South African/African history, arts, and culture.
                      The navigation bar is visible regardless of the page you are on, and it is minimalistic. 
                      The website is experimental, which means that the user will constantly discover something fascinating when they browse the site.
                      I enjoy the usage of heading names because they describe the articles in that area.
                      <h3>Cons:</h3>
                      Due to the headings not being straightforward, users may be confused about what that specific page means. Understanding the meaning of the heading is necessary to comprehend the objective of the section.
                      The home button is not obvious.
                      As much as I adore the backdrop images, they are constantly shifting, which can be distracting when reading a text.

                        <h3> "The Need for Global Internet Connectivity" (Daniolou, 2020)</h3>
                        This article establishes the critical importance of internet access in modern society, noting that approximately 59% of the global population had internet access by spring 2020.
                        It introduces the concept of the "rural penalty" where isolated communities remain disconnected from global opportunities despite having unique cultural offerings to share. 
                        The author identifies several benefits of connectivity including global communication, access to educational resources, and business growth opportunities. 
                        However, Daniolou also acknowledges potential dangers including vulnerability to misinformation and cultural homogenization, emphasizing that technological literacy education must accompany infrastructure development.

                        <h3> "Internet Access is a Fundamental Right" (Kasapis, 2020)</h3>
                         This article by kasapis ,takes a more philosophical and rights-based approach, arguing that internet access should be considered a fundamental human right.
                          Kasapis notes that this view has been recognized by organizations like the UN and Amnesty International, with India's Supreme Court officially declaring it a fundamental right in January 2020. 
                          The author frames the pandemic as exposing digital inequality in stark terms, as social distancing measures intensified digital economic activity. 
                          Without internet access, people face significant disadvantages in employment, education, and access to information.

                        <p>Both of these readings highlight the growing digital divide and its consequences, with Daniolou focusing more on the practical impacts on rural communities and Kasapis examining the philosophical and human rights dimensions.
                            While Daniolou explores both benefits and potential dangers of connectivity, Kasapis concentrates on framing internet access as a necessity for participation in modern society. 
                            Together, they present complementary perspectives on a critical issue: Daniolou provides the practical rationale for expanding access with appropriate education, while Kasapis establishes the moral imperative for treating internet access as a fundamental right that governments should guarantee regardless of income.</p>
                        <p>Both of these readings were published in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, which the authors identify as a critical moment that highlighted and exacerbated existing digital inequalities.
                           And honestly they couldn't be further from the truth.

                      <p class="date">Week 10</p>
                      <p class="excerpt e-content"><article>
                        <h3> Internet Access is a Fundamental Right</h3>
                       Spyros Kasapis's 2020 article "Internet Access is a Fundamental Right" appears on the website of the Institute for Internet and the Just Society, positioning internet access within human rights discourse at a critical historical juncture: the COVID-19 pandemic.
                       Published in May 2020 when the world was grappling with the initial shock of global lockdowns, the piece serves as a timely intervention into debates about digital inequality that were suddenly thrust into mainstream consciousness.
                       Kasapis's primary aim is to argue that internet access should be recognized as a fundamental right, particularly in light of the pandemic's acceleration of digital dependency. The author seeks to establish this position through several interconnected objectives:
                       To frame internet access within established human rights discourse. To highlight how the pandemic exposed and exacerbated digital inequalities. To position the Institute for Internet and the Just Society as an authority on digital rights issues
                       <ul>
                        <li> Historical/philosophical framing: The piece opens with a reference to Salvador Allende's conception of happiness as a human right, establishing a conceptual lineage for considering internet access similarly.</li>
                        <li>Appeals to institutional authority: Kasapis cites recognition from the United Nations, Amnesty International, and the Indian Supreme Court to legitimize the claim of internet access as a right.</li>
                        <li>Contextual analysis: The pandemic serves as a real-time case study demonstrating the consequences of digital exclusion.</li>
                        <li>Connecting to broader sociopolitical critique: The author links digital inequality to critiques of "Western capitalist societies," framing the issue within larger discussions of systemic inequality.</li>
                      </ul>
                      Structurally, the article moves from conceptual framing to concrete contemporary examples before concluding with forward-looking questions and positioning the Institute as part of the solution.<br/>Kasapis develops several interconnected arguments:
                       <ul>
                        <li>Internet access as a prerequisite for other rights: Following Allende's logic, the author positions internet access as necessary for exercising other established rights, particularly during the pandemic when education, work, and commerce shifted online.</li>
                        <li>Digital inequality as an extension of economic inequality: The article argues that "we are now not only talking about widening the gap between economic inequalities, but about a new kind of digital inequality." This framing positions digital exclusion not as a separate issue but as a manifestation of existing social injustice.</li>
                        <li>The pandemic as revealing underlying structural problems: Kasapis argues that COVID-19's "positive character" is that it highlighted these pre-existing inequalities, making them impossible to ignore.</li>
                        <li>The concentration of digital power: By contrasting Jeff Bezos's expanding empire with the fact that "almost half of the world's population does not have access to this digital social and economic network," Kasapis points to the concentration of digital power as a critical problem.</li>
                       </ul>
                       The article concludes by posing two fundamental questions: whether universal internet access should be a government responsibility, and who should govern the internet and by what rules.
                      <h3> Critical Reflection on Conclusions</h3>
                      While Kasapis's argument is compelling in many respects, several aspects merit critical examination:<br/>
                      <br/>

                      The article lacks substantive empirical evidence about the scale and nature of digital exclusion. As Ragnedda and Muschert (2013) have argued in "The Digital Divide:
                      The Internet and Social Inequality in International Perspective," digital inequality is multidimensional, involving not just access but skills, usage patterns, and outcomes. Kasapis's framing sometimes reduces this complexity to a binary of access/non-access.
                      The claim that the pandemic has a "positive character" in highlighting inequalities is potentially problematic. As Crawford and Walters (2021) note in their work on COVID-19 and digital inequality, the pandemic disproportionately harmed already marginalized communities, making this "silver lining" framing ethically questionable.
                        <p>
                          While positioning internet access as a human right is powerful rhetorically, scholars like Morozov (2011) in "The Net Delusion" caution against technological solutionism. 
                          The article could more deeply engage with critiques of rights-based approaches to technology governance and the limitations of framing technological access as sufficient for addressing deeper structural inequalities.
                          The article raises important questions about governance but doesn't substantially engage with the complex geopolitical dimensions of internet governance. 
                          As DeNardis (2014) demonstrates in "The Global War for Internet Governance," questions of who controls the internet involve competing national interests, corporate power, and technical protocols that complicate straightforward rights-based approaches.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Broader Significance</h3>
                        Despite these limitations, Kasapis's intervention remains significant for several reasons:<br/>
                        <br/>

                          The timing of the piece during the early pandemic positioned it to contribute to urgent policy discussions about digital access as countries implemented emergency measures.

                          By framing internet access as a fundamental right rather than a luxury or commodity, the article challenges market-based approaches to digital infrastructure and services.

                          The questions posed about governance and responsibility establish a framework for ongoing debates that have only intensified since publication.

                          As we continue to navigate a world where digital participation is increasingly essential for civic, economic, and social life, Kasapis's core argument that universal internet
                         access should be guaranteed to all remains a crucial contribution to digital rights discourse, even as we must continue to develop more nuanced approaches to addressing digital inequality in all its dimensions.

                      <p class="date">Week 11</p>
                      <p class="excerpt e-content"><article>
                        <h3>Reflective Reading: Building a Feminist Internet in Africa </h3>
                        Reading Sheena Magenya’s essay Making a Feminist Internet in Africa felt like stepping into a room full of voices I’ve longed to hear, voices that echo my frustrations, hopes, and dreams as an African woman navigating digital spaces.
                         It is not merely an article; it’s a rallying cry, a call to arms for all who believe that the internet should be more than a colonised, capitalised echo chamber. Magenya’s reflections take the often technical, sterile discourse around digital rights and make it feel deeply human, lived, and urgent.
                        At the heart of Magenya’s argument is the belief that the internet, often framed as a neutral, democratising force; is anything but. It mirrors the real world in all its messiness, inequalities, and violence. 
                        Intersectional feminism, as theorised by Kimberlé Crenshaw, provides a powerful framework to understand Magenya’s perspective. Crenshaw teaches us that oppression is not monolithic, it overlaps and intersects. 
                        Magenya extends this framework to the internet, showing how race, gender, class, ability, and sexuality shape who is heard, who is silenced, and who is made invisible online.
                        
                        <p>
                          What struck me most personally was the notion that African feminists are often expected to respond to crises rather than create from joy, desire, or curiosity. Magenya critiques how African technological innovation is almost always tethered to survival, to problems like drought or disease, rather than play or pleasure.
                           That line hit me hard. It’s something I hadn’t fully acknowledged in myself: how even online, I feel the need to justify my existence, my work, my voice. As if joy, softness, or queer self-expression is indulgent, or worse, irrelevant.
                          The piece also unpacks the dangers of assuming that “meeting online” is a universal solution  especially during the pandemic. Access to the internet is still a luxury for many in Africa. And even when access exists, the space itself can be hostile.
                           Magenya reminds us that for many women, queer folk, and people with disabilities, the internet can be as unsafe as the streets. Online gender-based violence, surveillance, and algorithmic bias are not glitches, they are features of an unequal digital infrastructure.
                           
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          One powerful passage that stayed with me is the idea that “African feminists make more room for African women online.” That is more than representation; it’s about transformation. It’s about resisting the dominant narratives that paint Africa only in shades of crisis and chaos,
                           and instead inserting colour, complexity, glitter, and ochre. Magenya’s vision of a feminist internet is both radical and tender. It is a space where fat bodies are beautiful, where queer love is celebrated, where disabled women talk about sex, and where African people define themselves not for the gaze of the West, but for their own reflection and connection.
                          Magenya doesn’t offer easy solutions. Instead, she insists on collective, messy, joyful resistance; gathering feminists in physical and digital spaces to imagine and reimagine. Her reflections resonate with Audre Lorde’s insistence that “the master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house.
                          ” If the internet is built on colonial, capitalist foundations, then African feminists must rewire it from the roots up not patch its flaws, but rebuild it for care, access, and play.
                          In reflecting on this piece, I realise how complicit I’ve been in accepting the internet “as is.” I now feel an urgency to not only take up space but to make it. 
                          To amplify African feminist voices not as tokens, but as architects of the digital future. Magenya reminds us that the internet isn’t neutral; it is a battleground. And like any battleground, it needs strategy, community, and courage.

                        <h3>My Reflection</h3>
                        Designing and developing my website has been both a technical learning journey and a creative exploration. Initially, I had the idea of separating my portfolio into two distinct pages, one for image-based work and another for video content.
                        At first, this felt like the most “organized” way to approach it. But as I started to lay out the structure and map the user flow, I realized that having two separate sections was starting to overcomplicate the user experience. It added extra clicks and split attention across two nearly identical pages.
                        So, I made the decision to combine both media formats. My images and video content, into a single, unified portfolio page. This not only streamlined the interface but also allowed for a more fluid and cohesive visual storytelling experience. 
                        Users can now scroll through all my work without having to decide which "type" of art they want to see first. This change made my portfolio more intuitive and accessible, and ultimately more engaging.

                        <p>
                          From a technical standpoint, I made a conscious effort not to overload my site with JavaScript. I wanted the site to feel clean and lightweight, so I reserved JavaScript only for moments where it genuinely enhanced the user interaction. Specifically, I implemented it for:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>The "See More" content block, allowing users to gradually explore without being overwhelmed.</li>
                          <li>A lightbox feature that displays larger versions of my work in a focused, immersive way.</li>
                          <li>A filter button, which lets users sort the portfolio based on categories; a small addition that significantly improves usability.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                          These JavaScript features, though minimal, added a layer of polish and interactivity that made the site feel dynamic without being flashy or overwhelming. I also learned how to implement these elements in a way that maintains performance and accessibility; things I might have overlooked at the beginning of this journey.
                          One of the biggest lessons from this process was understanding that simplicity often leads to better interaction design. And beyond the technical side, I had so much fun building this. I got to play with layouts, tweak animations, and experiment with how to visually present my creative work.
                          It was incredibly satisfying to see everything come together in a way that felt true to my style; minimal but expressive.
                          This project reminded me that development isn’t just about writing code; it’s about curating an experience. The balance between creative vision and functional design is where I found the most growth. 
                          I now feel more confident making user-focused design decisions, and I’m excited to keep learning and refining my approach.

                    <h3> Ethics in Internet</h3>
                    As I reflect on Orgad's tribute to Roger Silverstone, I'm struck by the profound ethical questions raised about our online environments. 
                    This article has reshaped my understanding of what an ethical internet might look like.
                    I find Silverstone's environmental approach to media particularly illuminating.
                     He argues that the internet isn't separate from other media but forms "an integral part of this environment" with "multiple connections and interconnections with other media, technologies, 
                     and social, cultural, political and economic processes" (Orgad, 2007, p. 34).
                      This perspective helps me see that an ethical internet must be understood within this broader ecology, where resources "can be used, misused and refused, distorted and enhanced" (p. 34).

                    <p>At the heart of an ethical internet lies Silverstone's concept of "proper distance," which I understand as "the importance of understanding the more or less precise degree of proximity required in our mediated interrelationships if
                      we are to create and sustain a sense of the other sufficient not just for reciprocity but for a duty of care, obligation and responsibility" (p. 36).
                      This challenges me to look beyond superficial connections online and consider whether my digital interactions foster genuine responsibility toward others.</p>
                    <p>I'm particularly struck by Silverstone's critique that internet studies have "mistaken connection for closeness, and closeness for commitment," emphasizing that "closeness, even intimacy, does not guarantee recognition or responsibility" (p. 37).
                       This makes me question whether features like interactivity and networking truly create moral spaces or merely the illusion of meaningful connection.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Based on this reading, I now see that an ethical internet would prioritize "unconditional responsibility" over mere reciprocity.
                       It would be a space where users feel a "duty of care" toward others without expectation of return, creating what Silverstone calls "a truly hospitable space" that not only "lets the other speak" but ensures "that the stranger should be heard" (p. 36).
                        Unlike our current online environments where "exclusion or self-exclusion comes with the click of a mouse" (p. 38), an ethical internet would make space for diverse voices, even those that don't "fit" established patterns.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      An ethical internet would also recognize the limits of disembodied experiences, understanding that "distance threatens responsibility" (p. 38) and work to overcome this limitation.
                      It would move beyond what Silverstone criticizes as the "narcissistic notion deriving from the self" (p. 39) 
                      I now understand that creating an ethical internet requires us to evaluate online spaces not just for their functionality but for their moral consequences—how they enable or disable responsibility toward others, 
                      especially those who are distant "not only geographically, but also culturally, politically, sociologically and historically" (p. 40).

                    <h3> Justice and Ethics in My Artistic and Programming Practice</h3>
                    As a beginner in coding and web design, I find myself not only learning technical skills but also learning how to think ethically. Justice and ethics aren’t just theoretical ideas, 
                    they shape the real decisions I make about who can use and access my websites, how transparent I am, and what values my work supports.
                    Reading scholars like Zizi Papacharissi and Laura Stein has helped me realize how deeply digital work is tied to questions of access, inclusion, and power.
                    <cite>Papacharissi (2002)</cite> talks about the internet as a potential “virtual sphere” a space where democratic conversation could thrive. But she also warns that this isn’t guaranteed. 
                    The internet may allow political expression, but that doesn’t mean it automatically becomes inclusive or fair. She points out that people with less access to information technology, due to income, education, and geography are often left out of the conversation.
                    That really made me think: even when I designed my webpage, i made choices that can either include or exclude users. Is the font readable?Are the images alt-tagged for screen readers? These might seem like small things, but they determine who feels welcome or shut out. 
                   </p>
                   Similarly, Stein (2008) explores the legal dimension of online space, arguing that many parts of the internet that seem public- like social media platforms or forums—are actually private property. That means users have no guaranteed speech rights;
                   their access and expression can be removed at any moment. I had never really thought about that. As someone just learning how to build sites, I now see that if I want to make ethical spaces, I need to create them with intention. 
                   Maybe that means building small, independent sites for community use rather than relying on big platforms that can delete users without warning. Maybe it means writing clear community guidelines or making sure comment sections are moderated in inclusive ways.
                   Both authors challenge the idea that the internet is automatically a democratic space. Instead, they show that it reflects broader social inequalities unless we actively resist them. For me, that resistance starts with my design practice.
                   I’m learning to ask: who benefits from this feature? Who might be left out? For instance. I try to build with semantic HTML and CSS, not just because it's best practice, but because it supports users who rely on assistive technologies, same goes for JavaScript.
                   <p>
                    I also think justice and ethics mean acknowledging whose voices are centred. I see coding as not just technical but relational—about building platforms where people feel seen, respected, and heard.
                    There’s also an ethical aspect to data and privacy. With these readings i found out that every third-party script can compromise my users’ privacy. looking at Stein’s (2008) warning that private companies control much of our digital speech, I want to avoid replicating that model in my own practice. 
                    Even something simple, like writing a short privacy note in plain language, is a step toward more ethical design.
                    Of course, I still make mistakes. Sometimes I get caught up in trying to make things look “cool” rather than focusing on function or accessibility. But I remind myself that ethics isn't about being perfect, it's about being aware and willing to improve. Justice, 
                    in my practice, means building with empathy, listening to criticism, and designing for people who aren’t just like me. And again , there's definitely a huge room fro improvement that i need to work on. 
                    In the end, Papacharissi and Stein helped me understand that the internet is not neutral. It reflects our values or our failure to act on them. As someone still finding my place in this field, I now believe that ethical design isn’t something to be added later. It starts with the first line of code.
