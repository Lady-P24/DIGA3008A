                    <h2>HERRI: The Use of UI and UX</h2>
                </header>
                
                <div class="excerpt">
                    <p>
                        Herri serves as a South African journal platform dedicated to the preservation and exploration of materials related to African psychology, culture, art, and music studies. 
                        They aim to turn "academic work into public knowledge," in which I believe they have immensely achieved that goal. I chose to analyse this website because I admire the intellectual material they provide the public.
                        It is an insightful and stimulating website to engage with. This is evident not only from an informative perspective, but also from the experience of navigating the website itself. 
                        The use of User Interface aka UI design has been emphasised a lot in this website especially with the use of graphics, fonts and colours. 
                        I do think though that the use of User Experience aka UX design wasn't the biggest focus and this is not necessarily a bad thing in my opinion mainly because from an analytical perspective, the website is experimental, in a way that each page may stand alone without depending on the information from the preceding page since each page the user lands on is written by a separate author. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        The fundamental principles of User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) design hold paramount importance within the sphere of a developer.
                        Nasrullah Hamidi has a concise way of explaining these terms. According to <cite>Hamidli (2023)</cite>, UI is characterized as "the visual and interactive elements of a digital product that users see and interact with." 
                        This includes the use of colour schemes, graphics, icons, buttons and the layout of a website. The primary objective of UI is to create a visually appealing, intuitive and user-friendly interface, facilitating effortless navigation for users to navigate easily on a website <cite>(Hamidli, 2023)</cite>. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        UX is similar to the concept of UI, but rather than focusing on the visual elements of the website, it focuses on the user interaction or experience with the website.
                        This includes user flows (a diagram that shows the path that the user takes through the application to complete a task),
                        content strategy (a plan outlining how you'll create, publish, manage, and distribute content to achieve specific business goals), 
                        usability testing (a method to assess the ease of a product by observing how real users use it) and the overall user experience <cite>(Hamidli, 2023)</cite>. 
                        Both elements are important for the success of a successful website. The user interface and user experience designs are both used effectively by HERRI, but I believe they place more emphasis on the UI than the UX design, which does not lessen the website's usability or intuitiveness.

                        There are 10 issues on this website, and this is the home page of HERRI Issue 10, the page that you will find when you search for this website.
                        The designers of the site have taken much consideration and placed a strong emphasis on the user interface, as I have previously noted, given the illustration on the home page, it is clear what kind of content can be anticipated on this site. 
                        On the actual page, this homepage illustration is in motion. The weapons surrounding the silhouetted female figure move in a circular, radiating pattern. 
                        The composition of this graphic work is situated in a way that is aesthetically pleasing and a user cannot miss the focal point. One could further say that they've incorporated a golden ratio guide during the creation of this illustration <cite>(Beaird, et al., 2020)</cite>. 
                        They've done a great job at capturing a user's attention before they explore the actual site.

                        Further exploration of the website reveals that graphics are used extensively. One may argue that this serves as a kind of identity signature that feels like an art installation on this website.
                        Every topic has a moving background image that goes well with the title; these backgrounds use visual storytelling to further the cultural theme and differentiate content sections.
                        Creating a distinct visual hierarchy is essential for a website with a visually rich background like this one. In what ways does the design direct the viewer's attention to particular elements? Is it easy to discern between interactive elements, body content, and headings? <cite>(Issacharof, 2021)</cite>.
                        Clarity regarding the most crucial elements on each page must coexist with artistic expression in the design.

                        The HERRI website's navigation features are not conventional of what users are used to. The majority of websites you visit will have a hamburger menu or dropdown menu with all of your content pages, however this one does not.
                        The website only uses a drop-down menu when a user needs to access earlier issues of the website or earlier content in previous issues related to the same topic.

                        Users that are familiar with design or users that like to be challenged may find this site's more experimental navigation to be intuitive, but others may find it confusing.
                        HERRI may prioritise discovery and exploration over efficiency, which is an acceptable artistic choice but it has an influence on its usability. 
                        In HERRI, when users are on a topic section page, they must be aware of where they are before scrolling down to read the content of that topic, because once you scroll down, your location indicator disappears, making it difficult to remember your position in the overall content structure.
                        Not to mention the gesture ambiguity, which means that the interaction of dropdown menus and directional navigation may cause misunderstanding about how interactions progress through the site.

                    <p>
                        Let's discuss the present navigation items. The site's principal navigation controls are high-contrast red triangular buttons positioned at screen edges, which are visible on all pages of this website.
                        Despite HERRI's unique navigation, the red interactive elements establish a consistent structure by remaining visible on every page. The arrows make navigating between visually rich sections feel intriguing and unique, which increases user content engagement. 
                        Which I need to emphasise again it adds an art installation feel to the website. The site use distinctive typography that contributes to its artistic identity. However, when text overlays complex imagery, readability can suffer significantly. 
                        This creates a fundamental tension between visual impact and functional communication <cite>(Beaird, et al., 2020)</cite>. It's difficult to show this in screenshots, but some of the pages on Herri, particularly the content page, have text that is overlayed with moving graphics; this can be overwhelming when looking at it for an extended period of time, but depending on the type of user who visits the site, this may be exciting for them. 
                        However, for the most part of the website, I have to admit that their text hierarchy and colour schemes are pretty good, and they are worth considering when referencing a website with a blended and contrasted style.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        In conclusion, the visual components of HERRI issue ten take central stage in this bold digital experience. Even though the visuals may seem overpowering at first, they are carefully integrated into the website's design to produce a unified visual story. 
                        Despite being vivid and vast, the colour palette has a specific purpose in structuring the information and directing the reader's emotional journey through the many sections. The unconventional navigation choices, rather than detracting from the user experience, contribute to the publication's gallery-like feel.
                        By breaking away from standard website patterns, HERRI offers an exploratory place in which readers are encouraged to uncover content in a more organic, less linear manner; similar to the feeling of roaming through an art exhibition.   
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Although HERRI obviously prioritises user interface design over user experience approaches, this deliberate choice is consistent with its artistic objective. Because of this emphasis on visual impact, the journal effectively delivers its message. 
                        The depth of information is not compromised, but rather presented in a way that elevates the subject matter through creative choices. HERRI issue ten demonstrates how, when content and presentation are carefully matched, even design-forward digital journals can effectively communicate intuitive topics while offering a memorable, immersive experience.

                    <h2>Digital Colonialism in Kenya: A  Reflection on the Human <br> Cost of Facebook's Content Moderation</h2>
                </header>
                
                <div class="excerpt">
                    <p>
                        When I first read about Mercy Kiprotich walking into that gleaming office building in Nairobi's Kilimani district, I felt a familiar sense of recognition.
                         The idea that she thought she had landed her dream job working for Facebook resonates with me, it reflects our collective aspiration to be part of the digital future. What strikes me as profoundly disturbing is how quickly that dream became a nightmare.
                         Within months, Mercy was diagnosed with severe depression and PTSD, unable to sleep without seeing the horrific images that had become her daily reality<cite>(Muslim Views, 2025)</cite>.
                        Her story, along with that of more than 140 Kenyan Facebook content moderators who have initiated what may become the largest digital labour lawsuit in African history, forces me to confront an uncomfortable truth about the technology I use daily. 
                        Their legal action against Meta, Facebook's parent company, exposes not just poor working conditions, but a deeper system “digital colonialism” a concept that resonates with my understanding of how the Global North continues to extract value while the Global South bears the human cost <cite>(Muslim Views, 2025)</cite>.  
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                      As someone who has witnessed the lingering effects of traditional colonialism in African societies, I find this case particularly troubling because it forces us to confront how the internet we celebrate as democratising is built on the same extractive patterns that defined our colonial past. 
                      Through <cite>Mark Graham's (2014)</cite>framework of Internet Geographies, I can see clearly how digital labour recreates historical patterns of exploitation, control, and disposability, with devastating consequences for Kenyan workers and their families. 
                      Every day, workers like Daniel Motaung and his colleagues would review child sexual abuse imagery, graphic violence, terrorist propaganda, and hate speech content so disturbing that it would traumatize most people after just one viewing <cite>(CorpWatch, 2023)</cite>. 
                      As I try to imagine this reality, I'm struck by how I've never considered who protects me from seeing such content when I scroll through my social media feeds.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        What particularly disturbs me is how the work environment itself contributed to the psychological damage. Picture this; moderators sitting in cramped, windowless rooms, a stark contrast to the open, innovative spaces we associate with tech work, isolated by headphones and computer screens displaying humanity's worst impulses.
                         The relentless pace described in the reports horrifies me. Supervisors expected workers to make decisions about complex, traumatic content within seconds, with daily quotas that prioritised speed over mental wellbeing. Which makes me question the entire system.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        James Irungu, a former moderator, describes waking up in cold sweats, haunted by images of child abuse he had reviewed months earlier. He said , "I would see my own daughter and panic. The pictures would just flash in my mind, and I couldn't make them stop" <cite>(Rest of World, 2023).</cite> His wife Catherine's account of how the job changed him , "He became a different person. 
                        He would stare at nothing for hours, jump at sudden noises." Dr. Margaret Wanjiru's observation states  that their symptoms often mirror those of war veterans, "The difference is that soldiers expect trauma, but these workers were told they were joining the digital revolution, not signing up for psychological warfare." 
                        The fact that one worker attempted suicide after being abruptly cut off from wages during a contract dispute (Rest of World, 2023) represents, in my view, a moral failure of the entire system.  
                    </p>
                    What the <cite>Boston Review (2023)</cite> described as "mental torture" becomes even more disturbing when I consider that these moderators were expected to process hundreds of such posts daily. 
                    Sarah Kinyanjui's experience of being reprimanded for taking too long on particularly disturbing content reveals what I see as a fundamentally broken system of priorities: "They would tell us to work faster, that Facebook users were waiting, but they never asked how we were coping with what we saw" <cite>(Muslim Views, 2025)</cite>. 
                    <p>
                  
                    </p>
                    What makes this situation particularly cruel, from my perspective, is that these workers were invisible to both Facebook's users and Facebook itself. Despite performing what <cite>Graham (2014, p. 100)</cite>identifies as essential digital labour, the moderators were employed through third-party contractors like Sama and Majorel, allowing Meta to maintain legal and ethical distance from their suffering. 
                    This invisibility feels deliberate and strategic to me, It represents what I see as a sophisticated form of exploitation that allows companies to benefit from necessary work while avoiding responsibility for its consequences. The choice of Kenya as a content moderation hub was, I believe, coldly strategic rather than coincidental. 
                    Kenya offers English-speaking workers, stable internet infrastructure, favourable time zones, and crucially, what I see as desperate economic conditions that make workers accept wages that would be illegal in the Global North. 
                    <p>
                        The financial disparity is what I find most staggering. While content moderators in Kenya earned approximately $2.20 per hour (roughly R39.19), equivalent roles in Silicon Valley can command $50-70 per hour, a wage gap of over 2,000 percent.
                         This isn't about skill differences, as many Kenyan moderators hold university degrees and are multilingual, qualifications  which I respect and value. It's what <cite>Graham (2014, p. 104)</cite> calls "regulatory arbitrage" the systematic exploitation of global wage and regulatory differences.
                        The human impact extends deep into Kenyan society in ways that I find troubling. In a country where youth unemployment hovers around a high percentage, a statistic that could easily include me or my peers. Jane Wanjiku had to sell her small plot of land to pay for her son's computer science degree, believing it would secure his future. 
                        This reflects sacrifices I've seen African parents in my  own community make. When her son became a content moderator, she was initially proud: "I told everyone my son worked for Facebook. I didn't understand what that really meant until he started having nightmares." Her experience represents betrayal of parental hopes and community aspirations.

                        Users that are familiar with design or users that like to be challenged may find this site's more experimental navigation to be intuitive, but others may find it confusing.
                        HERRI may prioritise discovery and exploration over efficiency, which is an acceptable artistic choice but it has an influence on its usability. 
                        In HERRI, when users are on a topic section page, they must be aware of where they are before scrolling down to read the content of that topic, because once you scroll down, your location indicator disappears, making it difficult to remember your position in the overall content structure.
                        Not to mention the gesture ambiguity, which means that the interaction of dropdown menus and directional navigation may cause misunderstanding about how interactions progress through the site.  
                    </p>

                        Let's discuss the present navigation items. The site's principal navigation controls are high-contrast red triangular buttons positioned at screen edges, which are visible on all pages of this website.
                        Despite HERRI's unique navigation, the red interactive elements establish a consistent structure by remaining visible on every page. The arrows make navigating between visually rich sections feel intriguing and unique, which increases user content engagement. 
                        Which I need to emphasise again it adds an art installation feel to the website. The site use distinctive typography that contributes to its artistic identity. However, when text overlays complex imagery, readability can suffer significantly. 
                        This creates a fundamental tension between visual impact and functional communication <cite>(Beaird, et al., 2020)</cite>. It's difficult to show this in screenshots, but some of the pages on Herri, particularly the content page, have text that is overlayed with moving graphics; this can be overwhelming when looking at it for an extended period of time, but depending on the type of user who visits the site, this may be exciting for them. 
                        However, for the most part of the website, I have to admit that their text hierarchy and colour schemes are pretty good, and they are worth considering when referencing a website with a blended and contrasted style.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        In conclusion, the visual components of HERRI issue ten take central stage in this bold digital experience. Even though the visuals may seem overpowering at first, they are carefully integrated into the website's design to produce a unified visual story. 
                        Despite being vivid and vast, the colour palette has a specific purpose in structuring the information and directing the reader's emotional journey through the many sections. The unconventional navigation choices, rather than detracting from the user experience, contribute to the publication's gallery-like feel.
                        By breaking away from standard website patterns, HERRI offers an exploratory place in which readers are encouraged to uncover content in a more organic, less linear manner; similar to the feeling of roaming through an art exhibition.   
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Although HERRI obviously prioritises user interface design over user experience approaches, this deliberate choice is consistent with its artistic objective. Because of this emphasis on visual impact, the journal effectively delivers its message. 
                        The depth of information is not compromised, but rather presented in a way that elevates the subject matter through creative choices. HERRI issue ten demonstrates how, when content and presentation are carefully matched, even design-forward digital journals can effectively communicate intuitive topics while offering a memorable, immersive experience.
