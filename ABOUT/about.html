                    <div class="about-content">
                        <p>Hi, I’m Pamela Phakathi aka Pammie — a film student with a deep love for storytelling, visual expression, and everything that makes us human. While film is my primary focus, my curiosity doesn’t stop there. I’ve always been drawn to art in all its forms—from photography to sound design and performance. </p>
                            <p>For me, creativity is a language that transcends medium, and I enjoy exploring how different disciplines can inform and enrich one another.

                                Right now, I’m also diving into coding and digital media, because I’m fascinated by the ways technology shapes how we connect, communicate, and create. Whether it’s through a screen or a stage, I’m always looking for new ways to understand the intersections of art, people, and interaction.
                                
                                At the heart of everything I do is a desire to tell meaningful stories and build bridges—between genres, disciplines, and human experiences.
                                
                                Thanks for stopping by. Let’s make something beautiful
                            </p>
